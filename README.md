## AOC 2024 - Kotlin

This project aims to share my solutions of Advent of Code 2024.

It does not aim at showing well designed code, the purpose is to show what I could achieve daily in a limited amount of time using Kotlin.

## Structure

The project is structured with respositories. Each repository represents a day of the Advent of Code calendar (folder `1` represents day 1).

These folders are simple gradle projects configured as Kotlin application within the JVM. Projects can be executed using the `gradlew run` command.
